# nextpermutation
This project demostrated the algorithm of next permutation on a vector with integers values. It can be build with visual studio 2019,
the project has 3 subprojects: "NextPermutation" is a console application so the user can introduce an array of number in the same line
separated by spaces and the application will respond with the next permutation of the array. "NextPermutationFunction" is a shared files
project with the implementation of the next permutation algorithm and "NextPermutationText" is a test project using the visual studio 
test framework for c++ it has implemented 2 simple test cases.
